    <h2>About Eiffel Tower</h2>
    <p>
        The Eiffel Tower has long been an icon of Paris and one of the first things that come to mind when people think of the city (even France). I can’t imagine making a TRIP TO PARIS and not seeing the Eiffel Tower!
        If you were to talk to Gustave Eiffel — the architect who designed and built the tower — he’d tell you there’s one way to see it. No, not see it — experience it. And that’s by climbing it.

    <h2> view from Eiffel tower</h2>
    <p class="tower-light-show"> 
        There are two viewing stages, one at the midpoint (which is slightly cheaper in price) and one at the top (which is just underneath that beacon of light you can see at the top of the tower).
        Both views are amazing but I think it’s definitely worth shelling out that little extra to go to the very top!
        Everyone loves to see the Eiffel Tower during the day. We get it. You want to see it in all of its glory. But if you want to see magic, then you have to see it at night. 
        Every night, there’s an Eiffel Tower light show that we can’t possibly put into words (but we’re going to try to). The tower is powered by 336 spotlights that feature a twinkling effect, which brings the tower to life for the first five minutes of each hour from nightfall to 1 am.

    <h3> Intresting fact </h3>
    <ul> 
    <li> The Eiffel Tower has to be repainted by hand about every 7 years to prevent rust and damage by pollution, requiring about 60 tonnes of paint! The initial color of the Eiffel Tower was reddish brown and it changed over the years. The current “Eiffel Tower Brown” paint color has been used since 1968.</li>
